- Accuracy
  - Are the results accurate?
  The analytics methods have been reviewed by AFIT faculty advisors.
  The results are stored in the output object and are automatically plotted in R.
  The results are very impressive and are on par with my expectations for a Huf heuristic.
  Completely in line with my prior understanding of the LeapFrog heuristic.
  
  - Is it clear how the results were computed?

- Compilation
  - Did the analytic work? (i.e. install correctly, startup correctly)
  The package did install correctly. R asks me to update the dependency packages at install,
  however I declined to do so and there were no negative repercussions. 
  
  - Were errors encountered when executing code according to the documentation?
    There were no errors. 

  
 - Ease of use
  - Is it clear how to use the analytic? (i.e. is the documentation clear)
    Documentation formatting is excellent
    Documentation clarity is excellent
    Very easy to get the package up and running with provided example
    Add git install instructions to the README.md     devtools::install_github()
    Add information about LeapFrogOutput class to the README.md

  - Are the visualizations/plots interpretable?
      The plots are intuitive and follow the standard format for this field.
      The plots were automatically generated, however, the plot tab did not come to the front automatically. 
      Add title to the node map.
